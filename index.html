            <p>Preface: I have no idea how the new support items work, and Riot will probably mess with them further. Sona gets a lot out of the blue item because her Q is fairly long range, meaning she can often Q enemy champs for gold.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In lane, no matter what you plan to build later or what runes you have, Sona can go oom. As a general rule, you won't go oom if you only Q enemy champions when manaflow band is up (every 15s). In these early levels you don't even skill E as it isn't worth the mana. Q is more efficient if you hit 2 people with it, and W is more efficient if neither you nor your adc are full HP, so you both benefit from the heal. You should also try to save it to block incoming damage.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If you take a lot of damage in levels 1-2, do not try to heal yourself solely with W. You will quickly go oom and heal very little HP. Instead, use potions and save mana. What looks like a huge chunk out of Sona's health bar can actually be healed by a potion since your total HP is so low. W heals only 30+0.25 AP and costs 80 mana at level 1, so all you do for yourself by spamming it early is gimp yourself later.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As an aside, Sona AD's gold generation used to rely on upgrading your support item, which meant resetting and tping back to lane as soon as you hit 450 gold. In that case it was worth it to waste mana and take bad trades early (as long as you didn't die) because you would just tp back. But now that you don't buy support item upgrades, Sona AD might follow the trading patterns of Sona support more closely.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The single most important thing about Sona is consistently taking opportunities to Q. Note that because of the range on Q using it around every 15 seconds, or even more frequently if you have the mana for it, is actually fairly reliable. Even in matchups like Thresh that are supposed to be bad for Sona (and they really can go terribly wrong) the range means you can still get safe trades. Even in matchups like Nautilus where your Q damage barely scratches them, your support item still gives you gold for hitting them. The Q gold is critical because it means Sona has reliable gold generation to help her scale.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                There are many cases where you can get close enough to Q but not close enough to auto. You will do more damage and get more gold if you can auto after a Q, so you should if you can. But often going in range to auto means the enemy botlane can trade back onto you, and unless it's obviously worth it for you, you don't want to take any trade as Sona putting you in range for the enemy botlane to strike back. To improve, try going for Qs and even autos that seem a bit greedy or risky. If the enemy botlane punishes you, you learn you can't take those, and once you build good habits you will automatically go for Qs without getting caught.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                It's usually good to position about as far up as your adc in the lane. Of  course, this changes depending on HP and whatnot, but it helps with a much stricter rule: if your adc is trading, you should too. Positioning that would otherwise be unsafe is often fine if they are focused on hitting your adc. You also want keep hitting 2 enemies with Q in mind (but don't let that stop you from pressing Q to hit one person). One last thing to consider is if you Q with aery up while standing near your adc, the aura means aery shields your adc instead of doing damage, which is better if they take damage but useless if they don't. These are just guidelines; in practice you should just do whatever the situation warrants. That means you need to get a feeling for positioning. Again, to improve try to go as far up as you can, then if it turns out you were too far up figure out why. Eventually positioning Sona will come naturally.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In lane, Q is the best power chord for trading if you're poking without retaliation. In some fights it's worth waiting a bit to auto to cycle through spells before using a power chord, but most of the time in early all ins you'll just want to auto. What you can do if you have two stacks is auto, cast a spell (ideally Q), and that resets your auto so your power chord comes out immediately. This makes your burst a bit faster, but isn't actually as useful as it sounds, since it's pretty rare that you can just walk up to the enemy botlane and hit them. If it's something really unthreatening like Braum Ezreal or it's an all in or something this can be useful though. It's also good for hitting towers faster (side note: greed to hit towers 3 times for gold before basing, as long as it doesn't completely ruin your back). But most of the time the auto, q, power chord auto reset sounds neater than it is. Knowing when you can't get in range to auto but can get in range to Q is more important. You want to start maxing Q, but can switch to W at some point.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                qweqweewqwwqqwqqwqeqeqeewwqwweweweeq is a pretty fair representation of teamfights as Sona, earning her a well deserved reputation of burning through mana quickly. She also needs to conserve mana at the start of the game. However, it's only once you buy cdr and level R (because R lowers basic ability CDs) that you become crazy mana hungry. So even if you plan to go seraphs, getting the tear on your first back is often unnecessary. It can be good vs lanes you need to outsustain, but when you can all in the enemy bot lane you can just get the lost chapter first, as it's stronger for combat. Stacking the tear early is not very important; you stack seraphs much more quickly once you get archangels. Also, if you don't have the full tear gold buying a lone mana crystal is really lame. Getting amp tomes or a dark seal feels better. If you're going athenes censer, get the AP parts first with fairie charms, ideally spending almost all your gold between fairie charms and maybe a pink when you back.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Censer athenes is always a good build. Censer is better to get and better to get first if you have a lot of champs who benefit from the passive. After that, crucible is actually good even with athenes because it only cancels the crucible hp regen, which is really useless on Sona because by this point you're healing yourself while mashing W to sustain teammates. So you still get the athenes ap bonus, plus another 20 from the crucible mana regen. Crucible active is less visually explosive than redemption, but turns out to be more game changing for Sona because you win extended fights anyways, but lose when important targets get caught by strong cc. Redemption is ok though because it gives a lot of mana regen. The new shurelyas might also have a place in an athenes build. If you're full cdr it's probably better just to get blue pots and needlessly large rods into deathcap though.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Seraphs is another option for more pure AP. The shield is also surprisingly useful once (like crucible) you get in the habit of using it. Fights often hinge on whether or not the enemy team can instantly burst Sona, and the shield gives you enough health to survive when enemies go in thinking they can kill you by a slim margin. It also is basically unlimited mana. The biggest part, the AP, takes stacking to come online. Note that your stacking goes faster once you upgrade to archangels. It's common to still need 400 or 500 more mana when combining tear/lost chapter but finish seraphs fast with diligent stacking. To be precise, you can get 120 mana per minute. A side effect of this is dying while you should be stacking is bad because you lose time you could be mashing buttons to finish seraphs. Archangels on its own is a bit of a power trough, so ideally that comes midgame, between early fights and 20+ minute barons. A ~22 minute seraph completion is good. It depends on the game and Sona AD gets it a bit faster. After seraphs lich bane is a good default. Zhonyas and banshees are ok to stay alive vs scary champs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Runes and items don't matter as much as gameplay habits, so it turns out that as long as your build fits how you want to play you'll probably be fine. For example, I've seen Schuhbart win by building kinesis shard+hextech revolver+sheen and bursting people with autos, which is proof that even if you complete the autism triforce you can win as long as you play appropriately. With that in mind, there are multiple options for secondary runes. I like inspiration because cosmic insight works well with seraphs. The 45% cdr lets you qwqweqwweewwq even harder because you have the mana pool for it. The flash cdr is always great on Sona and the item cdr is cool for seraphs shield. Free boots lets you buy combat stats for lane and saves 300g for buying more AP. Presence of mind and cut down are also good secondary because Sona uses mana and has low HP. Revitalize and another resolve rune works too for healing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Sona's ult is her only hard cc, as well as her only cc and long cd. So there's more room to use it right or wrong in fights than there is with basic abilities. In general, ult early. Don't prioritize hitting many people. A 5 man ult without your team nearby to follow or once the fight is already lost is useless. As soon as you can kill anyone by ulting them, pull the trigger. It doesn't matter if it's just one person, although it is better to angle it towards multiple enemies if you can. But in general just ult as soon as anyone comes in range of you and your team. The 5 man ult is a great highlight when it happens, but, majority of games, it's chasing a chimera. It's also important to ult early because you're so squishy - if people are in ult range, it's likely they can kill you, so you may need to ult them to stay alive.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Sona shines in extended teamfights because of her low cooldowns and high mid-late game scaling. In fact, Sona is a bit like an adc in that her goal is to stay alive while people try to kill her why she tries to carry the teamfight. It's good to position near your team, because a) you can buff allies with auras by tagging them and b) when alone you die easily. Also, at this point W power chord is very strong and should be your default. E is good for slowing, especially in chases and vs dashless champs. But feel free to just mash buttons and click people when you have a power chord sometimes and deliberately cycle spells other times. If you have lich bane and more damage clicking on enemies matters more.

    <div id="Soraka" class="tabcontent">
      <img src="Icons/soraka.png" alt="Soraka">
      <p>
          Pick Soraka with the expectation of winning lane, almost disrespectfully. You take Q at level 1 and max it first. You go Q E Q if you can because W doesn't help you poke. Playing Soraka is very much about hitting Q early.
      </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Try to cast Q inside its range indicator rather than outside of it. If you Q outside and wait for Soraka to walk up and Q, the skillshot is very telegraphed and people will walk away. Using Q inside your range is better because there's no obvious movement preceding the skillshot. Of course, this applies to walking up to immediately Q as well. Running up at the enemy champion also makes the incoming Q very telegraphed. The better alternative, again, is to stay walked up and wait to Q. There are multiple caveats here, so it's just something to keep in mind.
    </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            One frequent situation is low HP allied minions. These are obvious opportunities to Q the enemy adc, and that's ok. They will have to choose between going up and standing in range to auto the minion at the cost of eating a Q or missing the cs. Do not try to predict rapid movements; simply center Q on their position (in this case, where they stand to cs).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The obvious walkup preceding Q can also be an advantage if the enemy botlane squirms around under the pressure. Because Soraka trades so well, it's often worth it to go for greedy autos. It's especially worth it when the enemy botlane recognizes dodging Q is important and when you walk up they focus heavily on dodging. Note that dodging towards Soraka is an option, because if Soraka predicts a walk back and throws Q slightly behind it creates a window to step forwards, under the Q and into Soraka to trade back. Using autos punishes enemy supports from stepping into you like this on the trade, and if they don't manage to get out of the Q then Soraka can sometimes straight up win lane off of their failed dodge in.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Q is a defensive tool as well. Because it punishes enemies so hard for stepping into you, you can use it to zone enemies away from autoing you. Also, it gives movespeed when it hits, which means it's useful for kiting and running away from ganks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Playing around the enemy jungler is particularly important on Soraka because you want to be bullying lane. Your ideal position is not just walking up but staying up. That is, you're always in your minion wave, ready to Q when the enemy bot tries to walk up. But this makes you vulnerable to ganks. Warding and paying attention to vision and enemy pathing and all that is good. It's not the end of the world if you do get ganked though. You can often turn a 2v3 into a favorable trade, even in isolation, and winning 2v3 hard carries the game because it means you should win the rest of the map. The 2v3 is on you, too, because Soraka is usually the first target to kill. If they go for your adc, you can heal them and it may be easier to turn.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In general, you want to save you W for when you hit Q. But if you get to lane full HP and your adc is low you might as well heal them.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Again, Q is a useful tool for running away because it speeds you and slows enemies, and if you place it towards you anticipating the step up it zones people away. It gets more interesting in combination with E, though. The E cast is instant, so you can press Q first and still get the E off before they can do anything. The silence from E stops them from dashing out of Q, and the slow from Q helps to land the E root. People with mouse and hands can usually just walk away, though, which is why this combination is more useful as a reaction when enemies run at you. In a situation where you're poking a hook champ under their tower and need to run sideways to stay behind minions instead of straight away, the Q movespeed delta allows you to escape without getting hooked into tower.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            EQ can also be useful to follow up on allied cc. If your team hits anything, even soft cc, layering your own works well because the E will wait and then root. An allied slow makes E more likely to root, and E makes them unable to flash the slow.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Another good use for E is poking, because it's instant and should always land. You can use it when sitting in lane to poke and should never miss. Using the indicator to make sure you hit is fine. If you can hit 2 enemies with E that's great. It's also nice to proc manaflow.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            So Soraka's skills work well together and are good to throw out for poke. However, they have high costs - cooldown on E, health on W, zone control on Q. As such, you need to save them for when you can afford to use them. At the very least, if you E for poke you have to play appropriately safe while you wait for it to come back up. For example, if you have E up you can walk a lot closer to Pyke because you can cancel his hook as soon as he starts charging it. If you've already chunked the enemy bot low enough that they stay too far away to hit Q, it can be worth it to just E them, because they're probably too low to retaliate and too far to Q.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Since you kind of burn through your own health and your passive and Q give movespeed bonuses, celerity may be better than absolute focus. Comet is ok since you want to poke, although aery does more reliable damage on E. CDR is less useful on Soraka than on similar supports, because she is more gated by health (though it is nice for Q and E to be lower). So you take revitalize and then a) second wind if vs poke b) bone plating if vs engage or c) conditioning if safe lane. You can also go conditioning if your ego is large. The benefit is it helps you later on when Soraka is more vulnerable, as opposed to in lane when she's relatively strong and under less threat.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Going resolve means you don't have free boots, and in a lot of cases the movespeed helps Soraka a lot, so pick them up early and even upgrade them, not because you need to roam or anything (on that, be ready to R if it changes other lanes) but because the movespeed opens up a lot of ranges for you to play on. All the components of athenes censer are good on Soraka. Athenes first is probably better but you can rush either, they're both good, then get the other second. The other forbidden idol options are good too. In some games vs very cc heavy and magic heavy teams you can go athenes crucible in either order. Everything about the healing items makes Soraka stronger and for defensive options just position well and run away.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            So in teamfights, you don't care about doing damage (maybe sometimes you do, but as a general sense of things). Your goal is more to not take damage and not die, because Soraka has no panic button to press for self peel so it's easy for the fight to get out of control and someone to murder you. On the other hand, it's also possible for Soraka to heal a ton if she goes untouched in a fight. You never want to take, since your HP is more effective if you give it to other people with W for them to take damage. Use your Q to heal up yourself to keep using W as well as get a stronger W. Save E for critical moments when people go in, and get in the habit of reacting instantly to interrupt channels.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Zilean" class="tabcontent">
      <img src="Icons/zilean.png" alt="Zilean">
      <p>As with all of these, this is just my approach to the champion. Tempos, for instance, plays a more AP heavy Zilean, and you can build twin shadows/hextech GLP/whatever you want and max Q and that's fine. This is just my take.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I like to play around Zilean's E because it's a very reliable ability, and good adc players get a lot out of it. Q, on the other hand, I don't feel like I can land reliably. So to play around E, the earliest you can max it (for 99% slow) is level 9. This means you can put 2 points in Q and still max E at 9, and if you feel like it will net you a kill a 3rd point in Q at level 5 means you max E by 10. Once you max E, switch to maxing W.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In lane, you do have to play around Q early though. E can be occasionally useful to speed your adc up to hit or dodge something, but on its own does no damage so you need to trade with Q early. The most basic point is to not predict movement too hard. Instead, put your mouse directly on the enemy champion's feet, or maybe slightly in the direction they're moving, then press Q.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Zilean's Q hitbox is fairly small, so you need a reason to hit it. The enemy adc going for cs is always a good situation to punish, because when they go up and stand there to auto the dying minion you can throw Q so they either miss cs or eat Q. You can also wait a while to throw Q and just auto. This is a bit of a mindgame, because enemies may try to duck under the small hitbox into you, prolonging the trade, but if you auto and hit Q that works in your favor. And in general, because Q has a delay before it comes out but autos always land, if enemies are hovering around just outside of where you could hit them with a bomb you can connect with an auto. Another fun thing to do with Q is put it on an ally melee minion that chases the enemy champs down or kamikazes into enemy melee champs who need to last hit it.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        QWQ costs a lot of mana early and his hard to land, so save it for a fight when you can actually hit it. If you're just trading from range a single bomb is easier to hit and less mana. But if you are at close enough range and fighting, use E first then QWQ right on their feet to make sure it lands. Also, the W means you'll get another E back, so you have a lot of single target CC. This is helpful for when you lose 2v2 trades but then your jungler camps bot and you can set up a gank.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Hitting 6 is nice because most botlanes can't get through a healthbar twice unless you're really overextended, but using Zilean ult is tricky. Too early and the enemy team waits it out, too late and they kill before you press R. It's especially hard vs cc on you and large, fast bursts of damage. It helps to bind self R to a key (I use A, but whatever is comfortable for you works - the important thing is that you can thoughtlessly hit it) because in many cases you and another allied champion are both in range of dying, so having the self R key allows you to hover your mouse over your ally so you can quickly R both of you. You can also press R on a champion portrait, but imo this is an overrated tip, because in chaotic fights you want to keep your eyes on the actual position of champions rather than their pictures.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In lane your passive is available sometimes, but in many of those cases an enemy minion will die before you're finished using it. So just use it whenever you can and maybe if you're winning you get a big level lead and if you're losing you stay even. Outside of lane you can keep just using it on everyone, or you can save it for someone if their experience is your win condition (eg Kass).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        For the E focused approach, you don't need the AP and heal/shield power that traditional enchanter supports make use of, because all you need for E is cdr and mana. Redemption gives a ton of mana (+150% base regen, and Zilean has good base mana regen) so it's your first completed item. But before you have some cdr you may not need to finish it, so sometimes kindlegem or some other cdr giving components first is better. Also note that early early game pure stats make you stronger than cdr. So double ruby crystal into kindlegem and redemption can work depending on lanes and how much gold you back with. Redemption first is good too in other cases. Getting health means you don't have to worry as much about ulting yourself. Kindlegem no longer builds into shurelyas, though, so it may be better to skip it or go glacial shroud if vs AD instead. You also want to upgrade boots early so you don't have to E yourself as often. From there rush 45% cdr with redemption the only completed item, as it should be enough mana to support your cdr. This build fits nicely with a meta of games ending quickly, because most are either over or effectively over by the time you finish redemption/components/boots.
