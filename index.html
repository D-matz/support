      <p>Preface: I have no idea how the new support items work, and Riot will probably mess with them further. Sona gets a lot out of the blue item because her Q is fairly long range, meaning she can often Q enemy champs for gold.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      In lane, no matter what you plan to build later or what runes you have, Sona can go oom. As a general rule, you won't go oom if you only Q enemy champions when manaflow band is up (every 15s). In these early levels you don't even skill E as it isn't worth the mana. Q is more efficient if you hit 2 people with it, and W is more efficient if neither you nor your adc are full HP, so you both benefit from the heal. You should also try to save it to block incoming damage.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      If you take a lot of damage in levels 1-2, do not try to heal yourself solely with W. You will quickly go oom and heal very little HP. Instead, use potions and save mana. What looks like a huge chunk out of Sona's health bar can actually be healed by a potion since your total HP is so low. W heals only 30+0.25 AP and costs 80 mana at level 1, so all you do for yourself by spamming it early is gimp yourself later.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      As an aside, Sona AD's gold generation used to rely on upgrading your support item, which meant resetting and tping back to lane as soon as you hit 450 gold. In that case it was worth it to waste mana and take bad trades early (as long as you didn't die) because you would just tp back. But now that you don't buy support item upgrades, Sona AD might follow the trading patterns of Sona support more closely.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      The single most important thing about Sona is consistently taking opportunities to Q. Note that because of the range on Q using it around every 15 seconds, or even more frequently if you have the mana for it, is actually fairly reliable. Even in matchups like Thresh that are supposed to be bad for Sona (and they really can go terribly wrong) the range means you can still get safe trades. Even in matchups like Nautilus where your Q damage barely scratches them, your support item still gives you gold for hitting them. The Q gold is critical because it means Sona has reliable gold generation to help her scale.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      There are many cases where you can get close enough to Q but not close enough to auto. You will do more damage and get more gold if you can auto after a Q, so you should if you can. But often going in range to auto means the enemy botlane can trade back onto you, and unless it's obviously worth it for you, you don't want to take any trade as Sona putting you in range for the enemy botlane to strike back. To improve, try going for Qs and even autos that seem a bit greedy or risky. If the enemy botlane punishes you, you learn you can't take those, and once you build good habits you will automatically go for Qs without getting caught.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      It's usually good to position about as far up as your adc in the lane. Of  course, this changes depending on HP and whatnot, but it helps with a much stricter rule: if your adc is trading, you should too. Positioning that would otherwise be unsafe is often fine if they are focused on hitting your adc. You also want keep hitting 2 enemies with Q in mind (but don't let that stop you from pressing Q to hit one person). One last thing to consider is if you Q with aery up while standing near your adc, the aura means aery shields your adc instead of doing damage, which is better if they take damage but useless if they don't. These are just guidelines; in practice you should just do whatever the situation warrants. That means you need to get a feeling for positioning. Again, to improve try to go as far up as you can, then if it turns out you were too far up figure out why. Eventually positioning Sona will come naturally.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
     In lane, Q is the best power chord for trading if you're poking without retaliation. In some fights it's worth waiting a bit to auto to cycle through spells before using a power chord, but most of the time in early all ins you'll just want to auto. What you can do if you have two stacks is auto, cast a spell (ideally Q), and that resets your auto so your power chord comes out immediately. This makes your burst a bit faster, but isn't actually as useful as it sounds, since it's pretty rare that you can just walk up to the enemy botlane and hit them. If it's something really unthreatening like Braum Ezreal or it's an all in or something this can be useful though. It's also good for hitting towers faster (side note: greed to hit towers 3 times for gold before basing, as long as it doesn't completely ruin your back). But most of the time the auto, q, power chord auto reset sounds neater than it is. Knowing when you can't get in range to auto but can get in range to Q is more important.

      <p>
          qweqweewqwwqqwqqwqeqeqeewwqwweweweeq is a pretty fair representation of teamfights as Sona, earning her a well deserved reputation of burning through mana quickly. She also needs to conserve mana at the start of the game. However, it's only once you buy cdr and level R (because R lowers basic ability CDs) that you become crazy mana hungry. So even if you plan to go seraphs, getting the tear on your first back is often unnecessary. It can be good vs lanes you need to outsustain, but when you can all in the enemy bot lane you can just get the lost chapter first, as it's stronger for combat. Stacking the tear early is not very important; you stack seraphs much more quickly once you get archangels. Also, if you don't have the full tear gold buying a lone mana crystal is really lame. Getting amp tomes or a dark seal feels better. If you're going athenes censer, get the AP parts first with fairie charms, ideally spending almost all your gold between fairie charms and maybe a pink when you back.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      Censer athenes is always a good build. Censer is better to get and better to get first if you have a lot of champs who benefit from the passive. After that, crucible is actually good even with athenes because it only cancels the crucible hp regen, which is really useless on Sona because by this point you're healing yourself while mashing W to sustain teammates. So you still get the athenes ap bonus, plus another 20 from the crucible mana regen. Crucible active is less visually explosive than redemption, but turns out to be more game changing for Sona because you win extended fights anyways, but lose when important targets get caught by strong cc. Redemption is ok though because it gives a lot of mana regen. The new shurelyas might also have a place in an athenes build. If you're full cdr it's probably better just to get blue pots and needlessly large rods into deathcap though.
      </p>
      <br>
        <p>
            Seraphs is another option for more pure AP. The shield is also surprisingly useful once (like crucible) you get in the habit of using it. Fights often hinge on whether or not the enemy team can instantly burst Sona, and the shield gives you enough health to survive when enemies go in thinking they can kill you by a slim margin. It also is basically unlimited mana. The biggest part, the AP, takes stacking to come online. Note that your stacking goes faster once you upgrade to archangels. It's common to still need 400 or 500 more mana when combining tear/lost chapter but finish seraphs fast with diligent stacking. To be precise, you can get 120 mana per minute. A side effect of this is dying while you should be stacking is bad because you lose time you could be mashing buttons to finish seraphs. Archangels on its own is a bit of a power trough, so ideally that comes midgame, between early fights and 20+ minute barons. A ~22 minute seraph completion is good. It depends on the game and Sona AD gets it a bit faster. After seraphs lich bane is a good default. Zhonyas and banshees are ok to stay alive vs scary champs.
        </p>

    <p>
        Runes and items don't matter as much as gameplay habits, so it turns out that as long as your build fits how you want to play you'll probably be fine. For example, I've seen Schuhbart win by building kinesis shard+hextech revolver+sheen and bursting people with autos, which is proof that even if you complete the autism triforce you can win as long as you play appropriately. With that in mind, there are multiple options for secondary runes. I like inspiration because cosmic insight works well with seraphs. The 45% cdr lets you qwqweqwweewwq even harder because you have the mana pool for it. The flash cdr is always great on Sona and the item cdr is cool for seraphs shield. Free boots lets you buy combat stats for lane and saves 300g for buying more AP. Presence of mind and cut down are also good secondary because Sona uses mana and has low HP. Revitalize and another resolve rune works too for healing.
    </p>

      Sona's ult is her only hard cc, as well as her only cc and long cd. So there's more room to use it right or wrong in fights than there is with basic abilities. In general, ult early. Don't prioritize hitting many people. A 5 man ult without your team nearby to follow or once the fight is already lost is useless. As soon as you can kill anyone by ulting them, pull the trigger. It doesn't matter if it's just one person, although it is better to angle it towards multiple enemies if you can. But in general just ult as soon as anyone comes in range of you and your team. The 5 man ult is a great highlight when it happens, but, majority of games, it's chasing a chimera. It's also important to ult early because you're so squishy - if people are in ult range, it's likely they can kill you, so you may need to ult them to stay alive.
      </p>
      <br>
       <p>
      Sona shines in extended teamfights because of her low cooldowns and high scaling. In fact, Sona is a bit like an adc in that her goal is to stay alive while people try to kill her why she tries to carry the teamfight. It's good to position near your team, because a) you can buff allies with auras by tagging them and b) when alone you die easily. Also, at this point W power chord is very strong and should be your default. E is good for slowing, especially in chases and vs dashless champs. But feel free to just mash buttons and click people when you have a power chord sometimes and deliberately cycle spells other times. If you have lich bane and more damage clicking on enemies matters more.
