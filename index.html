            Windspeaker's Blessing
        </p>
        <br>
    <p>Maxing W first with mobis and domination second is a thing people do and it's worth a try to run around W-ing people but I'm going to go over what feels to me like the standard way of playing Janna.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The heal/shield items give tons of mana regen so Janna's only time for mana problems is early game, plus W is too short range to consistently stack manaflow. And manaflow increases max mana but not current mana, so you probably reset and buy and get past the point of mana problems before manaflow does much for you. If you still want absolute focus/gathering storm you can go those secondary with guardian primary. Revitalize is great, second wind for poke or bone plating for all in or conditioning for value after 10 minutes is nice, and situationally you'll get something out of font of life or demolish. Sorcery primary with nullifying orb could also work. Inspiration and domination secondary work too (even if you aren't playing W max, you get AP and movespeed from domination). So in the end what matters is how you play and any of these runes are fine.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Level 1 W is usually best because it has a much shorter cooldown than E. But in some specific level 1 invade scenarios or tribush cheeses you could go Q, especially if you're confident you'll win the push for level 2 this way.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Assuming you do have W and get to lane at the same time as the enemy botlane, you either play to get level 2 first or back off and concede 2. Pushing is ideal but waiting is fine since they'll have to push a bit to get 2 first, and in some matchups you don't have enough range to go up and contest. Vs other enchanters and especially mages, if they play their range well you can try to hit minions but trading is hard. But Janna is actually pretty good at trading vs hook supports, which is really nice because they're the ones who have the super scary level 2. Note that in general, hooks are scarier than other engage for Janna, because knocking enemies back and away means less when it's you moving towards them rather than them towards you. But level 1, you have a good matchup into their all in. Also, picking Janna into engage matchups goes with going guardian to stay alive in all ins.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Staying in your minion wave blocks the hook, but it can be scary to not move back vs the threat of the hook, because if you chicken out once they step up they'll easily hook you when you leave the wave. But this is where Janna's W comes in - it slows them enough that you can kite the all in, since they could go on you when you W them but minions are in the way, and then the slow lets you create enough distance that they can't run you down. If you don't get level 2 first vs hook champs, they will grab a favorable kill/summoner trade unless you just give up on the lane. Fortunately, you can spam autos on minions level 1 and force them to eat your W, which is safe for you because the slow lets you get to a safe distance before leaving allied minions, and if they don't come out to eat your W you simply take the level 2 first.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        If you're safe to do so, you can also get in autos with W. Make sure you're keeping them at range though. In general, if your adc is trading, you can too (and should). Positioning about as far up in the lane as them helps with this, subject to change depending on the specific game.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        A second point in W at 3 is good for mana and forcing trades and damage, but Q is safer in case of all ins. Q is way too slow to hit normally but WQ can work, you need to start close to them or flash on them though. Also, because your fully charged Q moves faster there are some angles you can look for. You can charge it in a bush, targeting either the bush the enemy support is in or the lane. You can also walk up when the enemy team is stuck under tower and start charging it without taking aggro, then walk back before you release it and it hits. Charging Q is only reliable if the enemy champs are forced to walk in its path, but even if not you can still point it to where it feels like they'll go and, since you can choose when to release it, release it when it feels like they'll get hit (and then you say checkmate bitch and your ego goes to the moon). There's not much of a downside to throwing Q out for fun even if it misses, except having to play a bit safer for a bit.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Having Q up is nice because it stops people from running at you. The incredibly slow travel speed on double tap Q means the effective range is waaaaaay higher when people are moving towards you than when they're running away from you. So having Q up lets you stop the run at you, as long as they don't either dodge the Q or hit you with a hook right as they get knocked up. The solution is to angle your Q so that dodging it cuts them off from chasing you, and if they hook you can juke as you throw Q then go back to running straight away. This lets Janna poke enemies under tower or hit tower, even if they have engage and hooks, because they can't punish by stepping past your minions and running you down.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
       And, of course, Q interrupts dashes like Leona E and Alistar W. This is nice and you should try to abuse it. However, Janna is generally overrated as a counter to these champions because of this one interaction. It is a good matchup, but it they can punish you for trying to abuse it too hard by simply flashing on you and bursting you while chain cced. So it is something you want to play on the edge - it helps to rest your mouse cursor between you and them, so you're ready to interrupt with Q - but you can't take it too far.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
       Ideally you always E your adc, because they get more out of it in trades than you do. Janna has no AD ratios other than her autos, and adcs have those but better plus abilities. Furthermore, your adc's health is probably more important than yours. There might be situations where you're the only one trading and in that case you might as well E yourself. But in general it's best to trade at the same time as your adc, and when your adc is trading too it's best to shield them. React to incoming trades by shielding before projectiles land. Max E by level 9. 3 in W and E max at 10 is ok too if you can use W to stomp your lane.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Censer with Janna's E gives a truckload of stats and you usually play Janna with real ADCs bot so censer rush is almost always right. Try to spend as much gold as you can when you back buying whatever components of censer you can. Choose aether wisp over forbidden idol as long as you're still able to go up and use W and not just a shield bot. You do want to transition into the shield bot role though so continue buying forbidden idol items. Janna has good self peel and should be with her team in fights so defensive items should not be necessary if you play right.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        If you're not sure what to do, following whoever is fighting or your adc is a good bet. If any jungler is invading but particularly AD junglers, follow them and shield and whatnot. If you're swapping top with your adc, be aware that the enemy top/jg can probably 2v2 you (unless you have censer and your adc is similarly fed) and you need to ward with Q charged up and over walls. Also be careful of bushes.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
       Heal/shield power and AP is also great for Janna's ult, because the heal on Janna R is super strong. You want to use the knockback favorably but getting the full heal is often the most important thing. Sometimes I'll even just press R when not even fighting to heal back up. In fights, it's best if you can get a shield off before ulting. Not only does hitting cc decrease the cooldown of your shield, you want to fully channel your ult, and during that time E will start coming up again. By contrast, if you press R before E then your shield will just be sitting there, off of cooldown but unused. So if it's at all possible to get another E off before ulting, do so. Put E on whoever the enemy team will kill and, if you're not sure, your ADC is always a good choice. If you want to use redemption, you can't use it while channeling ult, so pop it before pressing R.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In some cases I would rather get a dark seal and more forbidden idol items than boots. But in cases when the enemy support tries to catch you rather than outtrade you they're probably worth getting, as well as when they have important skillshots to dodge. Getting pinks is fine, but try to place them in areas you have control over, otherwise you're just donating gold. If the enemy team pinks tri, first push the wave then charge a Q to cover clearing it if they try to defend it.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Late game you want to get all the forbidden idol items and stay with your team and peel. Prioritize whoever's about to die and the strongest players on your team. Save R for when E isn't enough and wait for threats on the enemy team to go in before committing more yourself. As the game goes on your auto damage becomes negligible relative to positioning in teamfights, but it can be valuable to slow targets your team is going on as well as position to interrupt or knock back enemies. The further forwards you stand, the further your ult will knock back. However, since the heal is such an important part of it, you want to try to ult in a position where you can channel the whole thing safely.

            Si Vis Pacem
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Karma needs to win lane hard enough that when laning ends she becomes the stronger support.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Obviously, something like that is true for every champion, but particularly for Karma you should pick another champ if you can't stomp lane. Doing so requires initiating trades early.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Starting from level 1, it's good if you don't have to leash because you can look for a Q. If the enemy bot has to leash red, you can sit in tri and get a free Q. Even if they know you're there and their jungler follows, your Q has the range and slow to hit them without getting caught yourself. And regardless of which side you start on, mantra Q has enough range to cross botlane, so you can just sit all the way up in the bush and Q when they come to lane. In a way this isn't even a cheese strat because even if they know it's coming it's still unavoidable.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Understanding how Q works is the basis for this and the rest of your laning. The key point is that the explosion radius is larger than the detection radius. Mantra Q and normal Q both explode upon hitting something, though mantra is a bit more thicc. Mantra Q explodes at the end of its range even if it doesn't hit anything, whereas normal Q fizzles out. For both types of Q, you want to use the larger explosion radius.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For mantra Q, this means having a feel for how far away you need to be from an enemy champion for Q to explode on them. Of course, if you're right next to someone Q is probably undodgeable. But you can also hit it by being the max range away from someone, because if you fire it so that it explodes right where they're standing, even if the Q doesn't detect them the explosion will still hit them. Because of the giant explosion at the end of mantra Q, the safest spot for enemy champions is actually midrange. Good players may try to dodge sideways and towards you as a result, to get away from the explosion radius.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Normal Q does not explode automatically. Fortunately, lanes in League of Legends are full of units known as "minions", which you can explode Q off of. But seriously, if an enemy champion is standing on top of a minion, you can just Q where they are and even if they move enough to dodge the Q, it will still hit the minion and the explosion will hit the champion. Seeing these opportunities to Q an enemy champion off of a minion is one of the biggest things to improve.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Against many skillshot champions enemies can hide in the minion wave, but doing so can help Karma hit her Q. This reduces the area of safe spaces for the enemy botlane, which you can use to help allied skillshot adcs. It does push the minion wave to Q in it. That can be good or bad depending on the situation, but in soloq it's often good to just push. It helps you hit 2 first, and it helps if you're pushed up but in an unsafe spot to get the wave into the enemy tower.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            If enemies are walking left and right because they're worried you will Q them so they're trying to move perpendicular to its path, you can simply walk up and auto them. Because you want to win hard early game, going for more extended trades is often good. Once people realize you're just autoing them to death they may give up and run straight away, and at that point you can Q them. Good times to look for Qs and autos are when the enemy adc is csing and when your adc is trading. But keep in mind that Karma's (mantra) Q often allows you to take one sided trades through its range advantage, which you lose by going in auto range, so you want step in to extend won trades rather than always auto.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Your W can similarly scare enemies into running straight away, opening up a free Q. Obviously, once the full W lands you can get a guaranteed Q on the rooted target. But W takes a long time and you may take too much damage for stepping up as long as the tether lasts, so instead you can go for a Q when they're running away to not get rooted. It isn't guaranteed but it's likely for many players that when they see the tether on them they run away and stop juking as much.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            You probably go QEQWQ. If you aren't winning lane hard enough to warrant maxing Q then you aren't getting much out of Karma. W seems possible to run at people level 2, but it can be hard to get the tether since you can't run at people without E, and in general having E feels better. You could also go QEWQQ. I would rather have more in Q for poke.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As you want to transition from bullying early game to supporting in teamfights, you buy AP early because it gives damage but also scales later. Magic penetration does not do this - it only helps Q, which is why I don't like sorc shoes and would rather get lucidity or rush other items. But winning early is much more important than if you or don't buy sorc shoes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Dark seal, athenes, and censer, as well as their components, help your damage early game in addition to putting you in a good spot midgame. Free boots help you get there faster, and cosmic insight is nice because cdr works well with karma's passive as having Q up more often will allow you to reduce the (already lowered) cooldown of her other abilities. Athenes is particularly good on Karma because you've been playing for Q which now heals a lot on your E. Censer also works well because you can spam E on your adc and mantra E on your whole team. Karma also benefits from other forbidden idol items because they give actives, which she can get full use out of despite weaker scaling on her own abilities. They also give a decent amount of AP through the athenes passive (this includes crucible). But the main thing is they help buff her shields, which you transition to playing around.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In teamfights you contribute a lot with E and mantra E. Switch to maxing E whenever feels good, maybe around level 7. You still can use other mantras in certain situations, but your default mantra for teamfights is E. Put it on whoever is in the center of your team so that it overflows to everyone. You can put yourself in the middle if you need to. Also keep in mind that the person you E directly gets a bigger shield, so if there's a target taking a lot of damage E them, but if you just want to give everyone movespeed and censer and a little shield you can E whoever.

        <p class="title">
            A Squirrelly Familiar
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I usually like Q level 1 but honestly E is fine too. The main thing is playing strong level 1 because you really want to be autoing to deny the enemy 2 first and get your own strong EQ.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As damage or shield, E is guaranteed to hit, but Q has a bit more range as a skillshot. The second Q firing from Pix has interesting consequences. You can "scissor" your Q to make it a bit harder to dodge. Another advantage of Q is it slows, making it harder for enemy supports you outrange to engage on you when you trade with them. A more subtle point is that even though glitterlance moves very quickly, Pix lags behind Lulu's current position. As a result, Q works like slower skillshots such as Janna Q in that it has increased effective range when enemies are running at you. As you run away Pix lingers where you were and fires from there, which is closer to the enemy champ. This is useful for kiting, as well as early laning, because a lot of the time you're sort of jostling for position with the enemy support. So when you're walking back and they're walking forwards, Pix will give you a bit more range on Q.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            If you have enough range to hit them without Q, you can take E for more guaranteed damage. I also prefer E when the range is doomed either way, because at least then you can use it to shield in matchups when you don't have enough range to trade back.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            So E and Q both have defensive uses. They work well defensively together, too, because often when you shield your adc they'll be in range of someone trying to damage them, and you can Q them from the adc.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            If you're doing the same thing but putting E on a minion to get in range for a Q, you're spending a lot of mana and cooldowns for not that much damage. So by default I wouldn't do that but if the enemy champs are just cowering far away and you can afford to use abilities then sure go for it. Later in the game, you can do the same EQ off of an ally for chase or poke.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The preferred trade, though, if you can get in range of an enemy champion, is E auto Q. E into auto is fast because E is instant. The Q comes at the end because the E puts Pix on them, so if you just put your mouse slightly behind them so that the normal Q hits you'll very likely hit them with either that or the Pix Q. Then the slow from the Q means you can either get out, or, if possible, continue to auto. E auto Q is what you really want to look for in matchups that don't outrange you. To be really aggressive, you can W yourself first to get in range to E auto Q.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Alternatively, simply putting E on an enemy and walking away is less damage but not a strictly weaker version. Since Pix stays on them but you still have Q, you can then look for a Q on the enemy adc, even if you put Pix on the support. It also means you still can Q whoever Pix is on, which should be a sure thing. Wait for them to move in a direction, since that puts some distance between them and Pix. Once you see that, Q their feet and Pix is still close enough it should be a sure thing. You can look at the Q indicator if it helps. Eventually dropping the Q once Pix's carrier makes the angle with Pix clear becomes a habit.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
           You can put a few more points in Q if you're killing people with poke, but switch to E max and then W midgame with Q last. You transition into a peel bot in teamfights.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
           Always censer first basically every Lulu game. The passive goes perfectly with the stats she gives to adcs and the stats are great for her.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Lulu ult increases max HP and current HP; it's not a heal. As such, it does not scale with forbidden idol items. By contrast, Lulu's passive, Q, W, E, and R all scale with AP. So AP is more useful relative to forbidden idol items for Lulu compared to other supports. The AP/mana/cdr are great from censer and it's not like shield/heal is a bad thing though. But after that, going for AP and cdr with fiendish codex is good. You may also want to upgrade dark seal into mejais if you're doing well, since Lulu can rack up assists while playing safe in teamfights. Lucidity (t2 boots are nice on lulu, so you can keep up with allies you W) and deathcap gives you stronger abilities, but you do want to cap cdr with enough mana to support it, and the forbidden idol items still have good actives and decent stats.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Cosmic insight and magical footwear help here as secondary runes. Domination wouldn't be bad either for AP and movespeed. Resolve seems a bit less useful in comparison, since revitalize does less than for similar supports. Aery primary is nice for poke on Q and censer on W (W ally before E other ally to give both censer taking objectives). You can go scorch over gathering storm for more damage early. As with other supports, even though you plan to cap cdr, hitting level 10 as a support takes too long to merit transcendence.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            To demystify Lulu's E and W, she can use them on both allies and enemies but choosing who to use them on comes to feel natural. When enemy champs jump in just W them. Shutting down an assassin or bruiser mid combo does way more than giving your adc a steroid. But if no enemies are in range, W an ally, particularly your adc if they're popping off. Usually E an ally for the shield on whoever needs it, your adc if you aren't sure. If your team is hard committing to a specific target you can follow with your own E though.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Because Lulu's R increases max HP, you don't have to worry too much about using it too early. It's still possible to waste it, but you can't waste it in the same way you would a heal. This means you can look to use it for the knockup. If you have a frontline champion going in on the enemy team, and they're surrounded by enemy champions, just ult! Don't save it. You'll get a lot out of the knockup, and they'll probably benefit from the HP. You can also use it to save your backline from enemy assassins. Just remember it's not a heal and can be used earlier than one.

As a general rule, you won't go oom if you only Q enemy champions when manaflow band is up (every 15s). In these early levels you don't even skill E as it isn't worth the mana. Q is more efficient if you hit 2 people with it, and W is more efficient if neither you nor your adc are full HP, so you both benefit from the heal. You should also try to save it to block incoming damage.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If you take a lot of damage in levels 1-2, do not try to heal yourself solely with W. You will quickly go oom and heal very little HP. Instead, use potions and save mana. What looks like a huge chunk out of Sona's health bar can actually be healed by a potion since your total HP is so low. W heals only 30+0.25 AP and costs 80 mana at level 1, so all you do for yourself by spamming it early is gimp yourself later.

                As an aside, Sona AD's gold generation used to rely on upgrading your support item, which meant resetting and tping back to lane as soon as you hit 450 gold. In that case it was worth it to waste mana and take bad trades early (as long as you didn't die) because you would just tp back. But now that you don't buy support item upgrades, Sona AD might follow the trading patterns of Sona support more closely.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The single most important thing about Sona is consistently taking opportunities to Q. Note that because of the range on Q using it around every 15 seconds, or even more frequently if you have the mana for it, is actually fairly reliable. Even in matchups like Thresh that are supposed to be bad for Sona (and they really can go terribly wrong) the range means you can still get safe trades. Even in matchups like Nautilus where your Q damage barely scratches them, your support item still gives you gold for hitting them. The Q gold is critical because it means Sona has reliable gold generation to help her scale.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                There are many cases where you can get close enough to Q but not close enough to auto. You will do more damage and get more gold if you can auto after a Q, so you should if you can. But often going in range to auto means the enemy botlane can trade back onto you, and unless it's obviously worth it for you, you don't want to take any trade as Sona putting you in range for the enemy botlane to strike back. You can even Q while they are sitting deep under their tower, because despite being in enemy tower range when your Q starts, your Q spends time in the air and you can get out of tower range before it targets you. To improve, try going for Qs and even autos that seem a bit greedy or risky. If the enemy botlane punishes you, you learn you can't take those, and once you build good habits you will automatically go for Qs without getting caught.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                It's usually good to position about as far up as your adc in the lane. Of  course, this changes depending on HP and whatnot, but it helps with a much stricter rule: if your adc is trading, you should too. Positioning that would otherwise be unsafe is often fine if they are focused on hitting your adc. You also want keep hitting 2 enemies with Q in mind (but don't let that stop you from pressing Q to hit one person). One last thing to consider is if you Q with aery up while standing near your adc, the aura means aery shields your adc instead of doing damage, which is better if they take damage but useless if they don't. These are just guidelines; in practice you should just do whatever the situation warrants. That means you need to get a feeling for positioning. Again, to improve try to go as far up as you can, then if it turns out you were too far up figure out why. Eventually positioning Sona will come naturally.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In lane, Q is the best power chord for trading if you're poking without retaliation. In some fights it's worth waiting a bit to auto to cycle through spells before using a power chord, but most of the time in early all ins you'll just want to auto. What you can do if you have two stacks is auto, cast a spell (ideally Q), and that resets your auto so your power chord comes out immediately. This makes your burst a bit faster, but isn't actually as useful as it sounds, since it's pretty rare that you can just walk up to the enemy botlane and hit them. If it's something really unthreatening like Braum Ezreal or it's an all in or something this can be useful though. It's also good for hitting towers faster (side note: greed to hit towers 3 times for gold before basing, as long as it doesn't completely ruin your back). But most of the time the auto, q, power chord auto reset sounds neater than it is. Knowing when you can't get in range to auto but can get in range to Q is more important. You want to start maxing Q, but can switch to W at some point.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                qweqweewqwwqqwqqwqeqeqeewwqwweweweeq is a pretty fair representation of teamfights as Sona, earning her a well deserved reputation of burning through mana quickly. She also needs to conserve mana at the start of the game. However, it's only once you buy cdr and level R (because R lowers basic ability CDs) that you become crazy mana hungry. So even if you plan to go seraphs, getting the tear on your first back is often unnecessary. It can be good vs lanes you need to outsustain, but when you can all in the enemy bot lane you can just get the lost chapter first, as it's stronger for combat. Stacking the tear early is not very important; you stack seraphs much more quickly once you get archangels. Also, if you don't have the full tear gold buying a lone mana crystal is really lame. Getting amp tomes or a dark seal feels better. If you're going athenes censer, get the AP parts first with fairie charms, ideally spending almost all your gold between fairie charms and maybe a pink when you back.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Censer athenes is always a good build. Censer is better to get and better to get first if you have a lot of champs who benefit from the passive. After that, crucible is actually good even with athenes because it only cancels the crucible hp regen, which is really useless on Sona because by this point you're healing yourself while mashing W to sustain teammates. So you still get the athenes ap bonus, plus another 20 from the crucible mana regen. Crucible active is less visually explosive than redemption, but turns out to be more game changing for Sona because you win extended fights anyways, but lose when important targets get caught by strong cc. Redemption is ok though because it gives a lot of mana regen. The new shurelyas might also have a place in an athenes build. If you're full cdr it's probably better just to get blue pots and needlessly large rods into deathcap though.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Seraphs is another option for more pure AP. The shield is also surprisingly useful once (like crucible) you get in the habit of using it. Fights often hinge on whether or not the enemy team can instantly burst Sona, and the shield gives you enough health to survive when enemies go in thinking they can kill you by a slim margin. It also is basically unlimited <s>power</s> mana. The biggest part, the AP, takes stacking to come online. Note that your stacking goes faster once you upgrade to archangels. It's common to still need 400 or 500 more mana when combining tear/lost chapter but finish seraphs fast with diligent stacking. To be precise, you can get 120 mana per minute. A side effect of this is dying while you should be stacking is bad because you lose time you could be mashing buttons to finish seraphs. Archangels on its own is a bit of a power trough, so ideally that comes midgame, between early fights and 20+ minute barons. A ~22 minute seraph completion is good. It depends on the game and Sona AD gets it a bit faster. After seraphs lich bane is a good default. Zhonyas and banshees are ok to stay alive vs scary champs.

            <p>
                Runes and items don't matter as much as gameplay habits, so it turns out that as long as your build fits how you want to play you'll probably be fine. For example, I've seen Schuhbart win by building kinesis shard+hextech revolver+sheen and bursting people with autos, which is proof that even if you complete the autism triforce you can win as long as you play appropriately. With that in mind, there are multiple options for secondary runes. I like inspiration because cosmic insight works well with seraphs. The 45% cdr lets you qwqweqwweewwq even harder because you have the mana pool for it. The flash cdr is always great on Sona and the item cdr is cool for seraphs shield. Free boots lets you buy combat stats for lane and saves 300g for buying more AP. Presence of mind and cut down are also good secondary because Sona uses mana and has low HP. Revitalize and another resolve rune works too for healing.

            <br>
            <p>
                Sona's ult is her only hard cc, as well as her only cc and long cd. So there's more room to use it right or wrong in fights than there is with basic abilities. In general, ult early. Don't prioritize hitting many people. A 5 man ult without your team nearby to follow or once the fight is already lost is useless. As soon as you can kill anyone by ulting them, pull the trigger. It doesn't matter if it's just one person, although it is better to angle it towards multiple enemies if you can. But in general just ult <a href="Images/greedo.png">first</a> as soon as anyone comes in range of you and your team. The 5 man ult is a great highlight when it happens, but, most games, chimerical. It's also important to ult early because you're so squishy - if people are in ult range, it's likely they can kill you, so you may need to ult them to stay alive.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Sona shines in extended teamfights because of her low cooldowns and high mid-late game scaling. In fact, Sona is a bit like an adc in that her goal is to stay alive while people try to kill her why she tries to carry the teamfight. It's good to position near your team, because a) you can buff allies with auras by tagging them and b) when alone you die easily. Also, at this point W power chord is very strong and should be your default. E is good for slowing, especially in chases and vs dashless champs. But feel free to just mash buttons and click people when you have a power chord sometimes and deliberately cycle spells other times. If you have lich bane and more damage clicking on enemies matters more.

    <div id="Soraka" class="tabcontent">
        <p class="title">Bananas Foster</p>
        <br>
      <p>
          Pick Soraka with the expectation of winning lane, almost disrespectfully. You take Q at level 1 and max it first. You go Q E Q if you can because W doesn't help you poke. Playing Soraka is very much about hitting Q early.
      </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Try to cast Q inside its range indicator rather than outside of it. If you Q outside and wait for Soraka to walk up and Q, the skillshot is very telegraphed and people will walk away. Using Q inside your range is better because there's no obvious movement preceding the skillshot. Of course, this applies to walking up to immediately Q as well. Running up at the enemy champion also makes the incoming Q very telegraphed. The better alternative, again, is to stay walked up and wait to Q. There are multiple caveats here, so it's just something to keep in mind.
    </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            One frequent situation is low HP allied minions. These are obvious opportunities to Q the enemy adc, and that's ok. They will have to choose between going up and standing in range to auto the minion at the cost of eating a Q or missing the cs. Do not try to predict rapid movements; simply center Q on their position (in this case, where they stand to cs).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The obvious walkup preceding Q can also be an advantage if the enemy botlane squirms around under the pressure. Because Soraka trades so well, it's often worth it to go for greedy autos. It's especially worth it when the enemy botlane recognizes dodging Q is important and when you walk up they focus heavily on dodging. Note that dodging towards Soraka is an option, because if Soraka predicts a walk back and throws Q slightly behind it creates a window to step forwards, under the Q and into Soraka to trade back. Using autos punishes enemy supports from stepping into you like this on the trade, and if they don't manage to get out of the Q then Soraka can sometimes straight up win lane off of their failed dodge in. If you get a banana flying in the air, being in auto range often means you can follow the auto with a Q because you're close enough to hit both.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Q is a defensive tool as well. Because it punishes enemies so hard for stepping into you, you can use it to zone enemies away from autoing you. Also, it gives movespeed when it hits, which means it's useful for kiting and running away from ganks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Playing around the enemy jungler is particularly important on Soraka because you want to be bullying lane. Your ideal position is not just walking up but staying up. That is, you're always in your minion wave, ready to Q when the enemy bot tries to walk up. But this makes you vulnerable to ganks. Warding and paying attention to vision and enemy pathing and all that is good. It's not the end of the world if you do get ganked though. You can often turn a 2v3 into a favorable trade, even in isolation, and winning 2v3 hard carries the game because it means you should win the rest of the map. The 2v3 is on you, too, because Soraka is usually the first target to kill. If they go for your adc, you can heal them and it may be easier to turn.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In general, you want to save you W for when you hit Q. But if you get to lane full HP and your adc is low you might as well heal them.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Again, Q is a useful tool for running away because it speeds you and slows enemies, and if you place it towards you anticipating the step up it zones people away. It gets more interesting in combination with E, though. The E cast is instant, so you can press Q first and still get the E off before they can do anything. The silence from E stops them from dashing out of Q, and the slow from Q helps to land the E root. People with mouse and hands can usually just walk away, though, which is why this combination is more useful as a reaction when enemies run at you. In a situation where you're poking a hook champ under their tower and need to run sideways to stay behind minions instead of straight away, the Q movespeed delta allows you to escape without getting hooked into tower.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            EQ can also be useful to follow up on allied cc. If your team hits anything, even soft cc, layering your own works well because the E will wait and then root. An allied slow makes E more likely to root, and E makes them unable to flash the slow.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Another good use for E is poking, because it's instant and should always land. You can use it when sitting in lane to poke and should never miss. Using the indicator to make sure you hit is fine. If you can hit 2 enemies with E that's great. It's also nice to proc manaflow.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            So Soraka's skills work well together and are good to throw out for poke. However, they have high costs - cooldown on E, health on W, zone control on Q. As such, you need to save them for when you can afford to use them. At the very least, if you E for poke you have to play appropriately safe while you wait for it to come back up. For example, if you have E up you can walk a lot closer to Pyke because you can cancel his hook as soon as he starts charging it. If you've already chunked the enemy bot low enough that they stay too far away to hit Q, it can be worth it to just E them, because they're probably too low to retaliate and too far to Q.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Since you kind of burn through your own health and your passive and Q give movespeed bonuses, celerity may be better than absolute focus. Comet is ok since you want to poke, although aery does more reliable damage on E. CDR is less useful on Soraka than on similar supports, because she is more gated by health (though it is nice for Q and E to be lower). So you take revitalize and then a) second wind if vs poke b) bone plating if vs engage or c) conditioning if safe lane. You can also go conditioning if your ego is large. The benefit is it helps you later on when Soraka is more vulnerable, as opposed to in lane when she's relatively strong and under less threat.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Going resolve means you don't have free boots, and in a lot of cases the movespeed helps Soraka a lot, so pick them up early and even upgrade them, not because you need to roam or anything (on that, be ready to R if it changes other lanes) but because the movespeed opens up a lot of ranges for you to play on. All the components of athenes censer are good on Soraka. Athenes first is probably better but you can rush either, they're both good, then get the other second. The other forbidden idol options are good too. In some games vs very cc heavy and magic heavy teams you can go athenes crucible in either order. Everything about the healing items makes Soraka stronger and for defensive options just position well and run away.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            So in teamfights, you don't care about doing damage (maybe sometimes you do, but as a general sense of things). Your goal is more to not take damage and not die, because Soraka has no panic button to press for self peel so it's easy for the fight to get out of control and someone to murder you. On the other hand, it's also possible for Soraka to heal a ton if she goes untouched in a fight. You never want to take damage, since your HP is more effective if you give it to other people with W for them to take damage. Use your Q to heal up yourself to keep using W as well as get a stronger W. Save E for critical moments when people go in, and get in the habit of reacting instantly to interrupt channels.

    <div id="Zilean" class="tabcontent">
        <p class="title">The Grateful Dead</p>
        <br>
      <p>As with all of these, this is just my approach to the champion. Tempos, for instance, plays a more AP heavy Zilean, and you can build twin shadows/hextech GLP/whatever you want and max Q and that's fine. This is just my take.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I like to play around Zilean's E because it's a very reliable ability, and good adc players get a lot out of it. Q, on the other hand, I don't feel like I can land reliably. So to play around E, the earliest you can max it (for 99% slow) is level 9. This means you can put 2 points in Q and still max E at 9, and if you feel like it will net you a kill a 3rd point in Q at level 5 means you max E by 10. Once you max E, switch to maxing W.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In lane, you do have to play around Q early though. E can be occasionally useful to speed your adc up to hit or dodge something, but on its own does no damage so you need to trade with Q early. The most basic point is to not predict movement too hard. Instead, put your mouse directly on the enemy champion's feet, or maybe slightly in the direction they're moving, then press Q.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Zilean's Q hitbox is fairly small, so you need a reason to hit it. The enemy adc going for cs is always a good situation to punish, because when they go up and stand there to auto the dying minion you can throw Q so they either miss cs or eat Q. You can also wait a while to throw Q and just auto. This is a bit of a mindgame, because enemies may try to duck under the small hitbox into you, prolonging the trade, but if you auto and hit Q that works in your favor. And in general, because Q has a delay before it comes out but autos always land, if enemies are hovering around just outside of where you could hit them with a bomb you can connect with an auto (Zilean has good auto range). Another fun thing to do with Q is put it on an ally melee minion that chases the enemy champs down or kamikazes into enemy melee champs who need to last hit it.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        QWQ costs a lot of mana early and is hard to land, so save it for a fight when you can actually hit it. If you're just trading from range a single bomb is easier to hit and less mana. But if you are at close enough range and fighting, use E first then QWQ right on their feet to make sure it lands. Also, the W means you'll get another E back, so you have a lot of single target CC. This is helpful for when you lose 2v2 trades but then your jungler camps bot and you can set up a gank.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Hitting 6 is nice because most botlanes can't get through a healthbar twice unless you're really overextended, but using Zilean ult is tricky. Too early and the enemy team waits it out, too late and they kill before you press R. It's especially hard vs cc on you and large, fast bursts of damage. It helps to bind self R to a key (I use A, but whatever is comfortable for you works - the important thing is that you can thoughtlessly hit it) because in many cases you and another allied champion are both in range of dying, so having the self R key allows you to hover your mouse over your ally so you can quickly R both of you. You can also press R on a champion portrait, but imo this is an overrated tip, because in chaotic fights you want to keep your eyes on the actual position of champions rather than their pictures. You want to time ult perfectly, but there are cases when it's better safe than sorry. If you give them guardian and save them, it's better than them dying even if the ult is never used. Or your ult simply dissuades enemies from hitting the person you ulted, leaving them alive at low health. This can be bad if the enemy team can easily just wait out your ult and take the kill, but in the middle of a hectic fight it's actually not bad. It lasts 5 seconds, and fights are often decided by then. Plus, it can be hard to ignore a strong carry for 5 seconds, so especially in soloq someone on the enemy team will often freak out and finish them off when the ult is a half second away from expiring. If you have to choose ult the most important carry, but don't be afraid to ult anyone who's about to die.

        In lane your passive is available sometimes, but in many of those cases an enemy minion will die before you're finished using it. So just use it whenever you can and maybe if you're winning you get a big level lead and if you're losing you stay even. Outside of lane you can keep just using it on everyone, or you can save it for someone if their experience is your win condition (eg Kass).

        For the E focused approach, you don't need the AP and heal/shield power that traditional enchanter supports make use of, because all you need for E is cdr and mana. Redemption gives a ton of mana (+150% base regen, and Zilean has good base mana regen) so it's your first completed item. But before you have some cdr you may not need to finish it, so sometimes kindlegem or some other cdr giving components first is better. Also note that early early game pure stats make you stronger than cdr. So double ruby crystal into kindlegem and redemption can work depending on lanes and how much gold you back with. Redemption first is good too in other cases. Getting health means you don't have to worry as much about ulting yourself. Kindlegem no longer builds into shurelyas, though, so it may be better to skip it or go glacial shroud if vs AD instead. You also want to upgrade boots early (mobis, but maybe tabi/mercs/lucidity could work) so you don't have to E yourself as often. From there rush 45% cdr with redemption the only completed item, as it should be enough mana to support your cdr. Ideally you get your item spike the same time you have level 9 E and maybe points in W. Also, even if you aren't itching to build AP, eventually turning a fiendish codex into an athenes or twin shadows is fine. This build fits nicely with a meta of games ending quickly, because most are either over or effectively over by the time you finish redemption, cdr components, and boots.

        If you do get these items, you're in a good spot to control teamfights. Your E debilitates melees and champs without dashes and really is good against everyone, although it can be hard to get in range of some champs to use it. With the 99% slow nobody can dodge an EQWQ without a dash or cleanse. But again, it's hard to get in range, so a more realistic pattern is to E yourself and run up really fast, then E an (immobile) enemy. Using your W after self E does mean you don't get to throw double bombs, but that's fine. It's fine to throw bombs out and miss them, and often you might as well before using W. You do want to press QWQ after E on an enemy but if you don't hit bombs it's fine. Since you're playing around E and have more single target cc and single target peel than reliable aoe, you want controlled teamfights rather than clusterfucks with everyone going in at once. You can look for picks in sidelanes since you have enough movespeed to catch people and rotate back to baron.

        Your E is also great on allies without any mobility who can carry with sustained damage like Cass or Xayah. But it's great on champions with dashes too! It lets them save Ezreal E or whatever to use as an escape. It takes a good player to use the movespeed well though, so just use E on whoever is doing best on your team.

        In terms of using as many Es as possible, W right after you E. If you're Eing yourself or a specific enemy or ally wait until the last one runs out to E again. Once you have 45% cdr and points in W you can keep E up for a while on someone by using W right afterwards. It's also good to bind a self cast E, which is helpful for running away when you need to juke and speed yourself at the same time.

        These midgame fights with E are what you're playing for and your poke isn't great, so you might want to start relic shield. But I haven't tried it and losing out on damage might make you useless early.

        Cosmic insight and magical footwear are a must for spamming E. From there you could take biscuits and go inspiration primary, but the keystones are awkward. Sorcery primary sounds fine. Resolve actually works because E procs guardian. Revitalize for R, font of life for E, and since you're a bit more vulnerable in lane bone plating or second wind for all in or poke, respectively. But you can do whatever for runes.

        As other enchanters benefit more from AP and heal/shield power, for Zilean you might as well finish active items instead. But these sort of end up being the same items, and the main difference is that censer isn't as core, but it still works ok since the stats aren't bad and with guardian or aery on E as well as font of life and redemption he ends up using censer enough to justify it in some games.
