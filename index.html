      <p>Preface: I have no idea how the new support items work, and Riot will probably mess with them further. Sona gets a lot out of the blue item because her Q is fairly long range, meaning she can often Q enemy champs for gold.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      In lane, no matter what you plan to build later or what runes you have, Sona can go oom. As a general rule, you won't go oom if you only Q enemy champions when manaflow band is up (every 15s). In these early levels you don't even skill E as it isn't worth the mana. Q is more efficient if you hit 2 people with it, and W is more efficient if neither you nor your adc are full HP, so you both benefit from the heal. You should also try to save it to block incoming damage.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      If you take a lot of damage in levels 1-2, do not try to heal yourself solely with W. You will quickly go oom and heal very little HP. Instead, use potions and save mana. What looks like a huge chunk out of Sona's health bar can actually be healed by a potion since your total HP is so low. W heals only 30+0.25 AP and costs 80 mana at level 1, so all you do for yourself by spamming it early is gimp yourself later.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      As an aside, Sona AD's gold generation used to rely on upgrading your support item, which meant resetting and tping back to lane as soon as you hit 450 gold. In that case it was worth it to waste mana and take bad trades early (as long as you didn't die) because you would just tp back. But now that you don't buy support item upgrades, Sona AD might follow the trading patterns of Sona support more closely.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      The single most important thing about Sona is consistently taking opportunities to Q. Note that because of the range on Q using it around every 15 seconds, or even more frequently if you have the mana for it, is actually fairly reliable. Even in matchups like Thresh that are supposed to be bad for Sona (and they really can go terribly wrong) the range means you can still get safe trades. Even in matchups like Nautilus where your Q damage barely scratches them, your support item still gives you gold for hitting them. The Q gold is critical because it means Sona has reliable gold generation to help her scale.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      There are many cases where you can get close enough to Q but not close enough to auto. You will do more damage and get more gold if you can auto after a Q, so you should if you can. But often going in range to auto means the enemy botlane can trade back onto you, and unless it's obviously worth it for you, you don't want to take any trade as Sona putting you in range for the enemy botlane to strike back. To improve, try going for Qs and even autos that seem a bit greedy or risky. If the enemy botlane punishes you, you learn you can't take those, and once you build good habits you will automatically go for Qs without getting caught.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
      It's usually good to position about as far up as your adc in the lane. Of  course, this changes depending on HP and whatnot, but it helps with a much stricter rule: if your adc is trading, you should too. Positioning that would otherwise be unsafe is often fine if they are focused on hitting your adc. You also want keep hitting 2 enemies with Q in mind (but don't let that stop you from pressing Q to hit one person). One last thing to consider is if you Q with aery up while standing near your adc, the aura means aery shields your adc instead of doing damage, which is better if they take damage but useless if they don't. These are just guidelines; in practice you should just do whatever the situation warrants. That means you need to get a feeling for positioning. Again, to improve try to go as far up as you can, then if it turns out you were too far up figure out why. Eventually positioning Sona will come naturally.
